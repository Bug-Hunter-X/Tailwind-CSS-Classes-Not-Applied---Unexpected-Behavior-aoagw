# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes are correctly added to HTML elements, but they fail to apply styles during the build process. The issue is likely due to a conflict between Tailwind's configuration and the project setup, or a misconfiguration of the build tools.

## Bug Description

Despite correctly implementing Tailwind classes in the HTML, the styles are not reflected in the rendered output.  The build process seems to execute without error, but the styles simply don't apply.  This behavior is inconsistent and doesn't follow typical Tailwind troubleshooting steps.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the development server (e.g., `npm run dev`).
3. Observe that the Tailwind classes are not applied to the HTML elements.

## Solution

The provided solution involves [explanation of the fix. e.g., verifying that Tailwind's configuration file is correctly linked, confirming that the postcss plugins are correctly installed and configured, and checking for any conflicts in CSS rule priority].
